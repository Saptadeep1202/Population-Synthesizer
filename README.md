# Population-Synthesizer

This project analyzes a sample dataset of 200 individuals, each characterized by three attributes: sex, age group, and highest education level. The dataset and its categories are outlined below, and the analysis compares this sample to the population characteristics of a specified region.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following variables and categories:

## Population Characteristics
The population characteristics for the three attributes are provided in the table below. This data represents the total number of individuals (frequencies) in different categories for each variable.

## Analysis
# Data Comparison
The provided sample dataset of 200 individuals is representative of the population whose characteristics are detailed above. The analysis involves comparing the frequencies of different categories within the sample to those in the population.

## Steps to Analyze
### Load the Dataset: Import the dataset and inspect the structure.
### Data Cleaning: Ensure the dataset has no missing or inconsistent values.
### Categorical Mapping: Map categorical values to their respective descriptions.
### Frequency Calculation: Calculate the frequency of each category in the sample dataset.
### Comparison: Compare these frequencies with the population characteristics.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into how a sample dataset compares to the overall population characteristics. The analysis involves mapping categorical data, calculating frequencies, and visually comparing the sample to the population. Such comparisons are crucial for understanding the representativeness of the sample and making inferences about the broader population.
